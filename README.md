TASK-2 {LANDING PAGE }

A landing page is a standalone web page that potential customers can “land” on when they click through from an email, ad, or other digital location.
This is a landing page for a website of Beach station . I have created this as a CODSOFT BEACH STATION , where It is a simple landing page with nav bar ,animation and a beautiful beach photos . IN this I have used html and css in one file to make a project a good look .
